    <h1>TOKE LAURIDSEN</h1>


    <p>Born in Lusaka, Zambia in 1972, Toke Lauridsen has been educated as stainless steel smith in Denmark to finally open his own workshop in 2007 at “Kødbyen”, the old Meatpacking District of Copenhagen and thriving creative cluster.

        Needles to say his all-time favorite design material is steel – and Toke has acquired a great sense of it through all his maker’s activity.
        Concentrating on one material brings a high focus to the job – Toke’s designs are as simple as possible, almost ascetic, delicate, yet strong and industrial – with no unnecessary elements.

        He likes to utilize the features of steel to the fullest to bring out the best possible forms, achievable only due to the material he’s working with.</p>
